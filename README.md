I am a passionate web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, currently working on a project called "Forms." In this project, I have implemented an API connection that directly sends data from the web page to an Excel sheet, eliminating manual entry. My goal is to continue growing as a front-end developer, contributing to innovative digital solutions that streamline processes and enhance user experiences.
